## 1. Elevator Pitch  
Magellan is the first end-to-end operating platform purpose-built for Citizenship & Residency by Investment (CRBI) firms, combining client management, document handling, program tracking, and internal communication in one secure, intuitive dashboard. Instead of juggling spreadsheets, emails, and third-party tools, firms can manage the full client journey—from inquiry to investment to citizenship—in a modern, professional workspace designed specifically for their industry. Magellan saves time, improves client experience, and helps firms scale with confidence.
